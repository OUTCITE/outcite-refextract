Negative examples: same reference string manually "broken" according to commonly observed extraction mistakes
made by Exparser: extracting several reference lines as one; extracting a part of reference as a reference) (num: 391)


## Grobid and Anystyle dataset
in progress: sample 200 samples and annotate as a reference or not a reference (and describe the definition)
