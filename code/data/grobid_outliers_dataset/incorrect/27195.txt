The concept also extends to dealings between citizens and their civil institutions on the one hand, and with representatives of state institutions on the other, in the sense that these should be non-violent and peaceful as well. Since state officials can also be regarded as citizens and as members of their societies, such dealings pertain to the same norm of social peace.

Examples of the recipients of such projects include mosques, hospitals, and institutions of learning, charities for the needy and for students, agricultural farms, public fountains and bridges. Awqaf were essential to the socio-economic infrastructure of Muslim societies from the 10 th century until the 20 th century. They also constituted an important socio-economic power base for the religious elite of the 'ulama'. Cohen and Arato, p. 436.

Jordanian Islamist women's and children's rights activist Nawal al-Fa'uri, for instance, who promotes emancipatory ideas regarding gender-and parent-child relations, firmly grounds her modernist visions in the text of the basic Islamic sources and within the framework of an \"Islam that provides an answer to every question.\" Al-Fa'uri expressed her views to me during interviews on 15 December 2003 and 7
One of the founders of the modern science of sociology, Emile Durkheim, analyzed the phenomenon of religion in his work The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, New York, The Free Press, 1995. For Durkheim, religion amounts to the signification and symbolization of all the social ties and values that members of a given community hold in common. Many Arab Muslims (and presumably Christians too) see this the other way around, regarding religion itself as the source of social values and cohesion. In the case of Jordan, see for instance Robert B. Satloff, Troubles on the East Bank, Challenges to the Domestic Stability of Jordan, Washington Paper No. 123 (Washington DC: The Center of Strategic and International and Strategic Studies, 1986), pp. 59-74.

Brand, In the Beginning was the State, pp. 157-158. The term \"Transjordanian\" is intended to include the inhabitants of the former Emirate of Transjordan and their direct descendants, thus excluding the Palestinians who have been incorporated into the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. This Kingdom became the successor of the Emirate after the British overlords granted it formal independence in 1946. While the term may be incorrect in a geographic sense, since it also includes those Jordanians who inhabit central and southern parts of the country where the Jordan River does not run, it is generally used in this sense by academic commentators on Jordan. Indeed, this usage may be justified in a politico- historical sense, since the area to which it refers used to be that of a polity known as \"Transjordan.\" Brand, In the Beginning was the State, p. 155.
